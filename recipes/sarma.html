    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Serbian stuffed cabbage, or <em>sarma</em>, is a hearty dish that many Serbs serve 
        every day but especially for special occasions like slavas and other holidays. 
        Recipes vary from cook to cook, but they all consist of a meat filling 
        wrapped in cabbage and cooked over sauerkraut. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (3-to 4-pound) head cabbage</li>
        <li>1 pound ground chuck</li>
        <li>1/2 pound ground pork</li>
        <li>1 cup raw rice, rinsed</li>
        <li>1 (1.4-ounce) package dehydrated onion soup mix</li>
        <li>1 (32-ounce) jar sauerkraut, rinsed and drained</li>
        <li>6 medium smoked ribs, ham hocks, or other smoked meat</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Cut the core out of the cabbage and discard.</li>
        <li>In a large pot partially filled with boiling water, steam the cabbage, 
            cut-side down. Reduce the heat to medium, cover and steam until 
            the outer leaves are limp, about 8 to 10 minutes. </li>
        <li>Use tongs to remove 
            the larger softened leaves. Continue to steam and remove larger leaves 
            as they become done until you have about 22 to 23 whole large cabbage 
            leaves.</li>
        <li>With a paring knife, remove the tough ribs without damaging the leaves. 
            Discard the cabbage ribs or reserve for another use.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix together the ground chuck, ground pork, rice, 
            and onion soup mix.</li>
        <li>Add a small amount of water to make the mixture easier to handle. </li>
        <li>Set 3 or 4 of the leaves aside. Heap about 1/4 cup of filling onto 
            each of the remaining cabbage leaves.</li>
        <li>Fold the bottom of the cabbage leaf up over the meat. </li>
        <li>Fold sides to the center and roll away from yourself to completely 
            encase the meat. </li>
        <li>Repeat until all the meat filling is used. </li>
        <li>Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat to 350 F. </li>
        <li>Coarsely chop the remaining steamed cabbage, not including the reserved 
            leaves.</li>
        <li>Spread the chopped cabbage on the bottom of a large casserole dish or Dutch 
            oven. Add the drained sauerkraut.</li>
        <li>Layer on the cabbage rolls, seam-side down. </li>
        <li>Cut the smoked ribs into pieces. Space the ribs or other smoked meat of choice 
            between the cabbage rolls. </li>
        <li>Cover rolls with reserved whole cabbage leaves.</li>
        <li>Cover the casserole dish and bake 1 hour. </li>
        <li>Reduce temperature to 325 F and bake for 2 more hours.</li>
        <li>Let sit 20 to 30 minutes before serving. </li>
        <li>Serve with the ribs.</li>
    </ol>
